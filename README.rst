Audition Rocket Inkscape UI mockups
===================================

Inkscape is a program similar to Adobe Illustrator or the Path tool of Adobe Photoshop, but a lot nicer, in my opinion.  Here are some UI mockups that I did with it.  Feel free to use these as a starting point for doing your own UI mockups for web apps.
